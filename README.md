# MXMapEngine
(unashamedly ripped off from [mapbox-gl-native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native) version tag android-v6.3.0)

* What
Customized Mapbox GL Native library isolated for use on Android. 

* Why
Although Mapbox is awesome, I want repeatable builds that does not rely so heavily on the success or existence of third parties.
