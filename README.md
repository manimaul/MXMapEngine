Android Only MapBox-GL-Native based map rendering library
(unashamedly ripped off from [mapbox-gl-native](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native) version tag android-v6.3.0)

* What?

Customized Mapbox GL Native library isolated for use on Android. Isolated = This only uses the Android/CMake build system and does *NOT* rely upon [mason](https://github.com/mapbox/mason) for dependencies.

* Why?

Although Mapbox is awesome, I want repeatable builds that does not rely so heavily on the success or existence of third parties.

* Status?
